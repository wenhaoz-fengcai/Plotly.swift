To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2.

For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M<n>* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*
