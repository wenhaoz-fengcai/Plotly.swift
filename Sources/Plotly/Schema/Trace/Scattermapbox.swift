For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M<n>* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*
